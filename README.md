 2048 Game

A web-based implementation of the popular 2048 puzzle game blt using "HTML", "CSS", and "JavaScript". Players combine numbered tiles by sliding them across the grid, aiming to reach the 2048 tile by merging smaller tiles.

 Demo
You can play the game by visiting [Live Demo](). *(You can replace `` with your live link if hosted.)*

 Features
- "Simple Sliding Mechanics": Use the arrow keys to slide tiles in different directions (left, right, up, down).
- "Score Tracking": The game tracks your score as you combine tiles.
- "Responsive ": The game grid adjusts and displays well on various screen sizes.
- "Reset Button": Easily reset the game to start over.

 How to Play
1. Use the "arrow keys" on your keyboard to move tiles in different directions.
2. Tiles with the same number will merge when they touch, and their values will be added together.
3. Your goal is to "reach the 2048 tile", but you can keep playing to get a higher score.
4. The game ends when no valid moves are available, and the grid is full.

 How It Works
- "HTML" provides the basic structure for the game grid and controls.
- "CSS" is used to style the grid, tiles, and overall layout.
- "JavaScript" handles the game logic, including:
  - Initializing the game grid.
  - Handling tile movements and merging.
  - Spawning new tiles after each move.
  - Updating the score and rendering the updated board.

 Future Enhancements
- "Game Over/Winning Message": Add an overlay when the game is won or lost.
- "Undo Feature": Allow users to undo their previous move.
- "Animations": Implement animations for tile movement and merging for a smoother user experience.
